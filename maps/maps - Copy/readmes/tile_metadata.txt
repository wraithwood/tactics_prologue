Tile metadata is what we will use to allow you to communicate the maps built to me
so I can use a cell's properties when creating logic. 

I will create a tileset specifically for marking properties of cell. You should be responsible
for using it as a layer in your map building.

I'm working on a semantic numbering convention to represent traversibility / other properties.
We are limited a bit by the size of a 16x16 grid in what I can visually represent to you on the tile,
but that is our only limitation. We can add as many properties as we like, technically, and I can
consume them in the logic.

Right now, I have prepared a very simple tileset where 1 is walkable, and 2 is not.
